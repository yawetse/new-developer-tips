### [Coding Without Comments](http://blog.codinghorror.com/coding-without-comments/)
> You should always write your code as if comments didn't exist. This forces you to write your code in the simplest, plainest, most self-documenting way you can humanly come up with.

> When you've rewritten, refactored, and rearchitected your code a dozen times to make it easy for your fellow developers to read and understand -- when you can't possibly imagine any conceivable way your code could be changed to become more straightforward and obvious -- then, and only then, should you feel compelled to add a comment explaining what your code does.

> Writing good, meaningful comments is hard. It's as much an art as writing the code itself; maybe even more so. As Sammy Larbi said in Common Excuses Used To Comment Code, if your feel your code is too complex to understand without comments, your code is probably just bad. Rewrite it until it doesn't need comments any more. If, at the end of that effort, you still feel comments are necessary, then by all means, add comments. Carefully.

1. This code is too complicated!
2. Keep It Simple Stupid (KISS)
3. Comment your Code
4. Unit Testing!
5. Descriptive Variable Names

### [Don’t be clever](http://www.codethinked.com/dont-be-clever)

> The shift is that the complexity in software has moved from the smaller parts of the applications to the design of the application as a whole, and so the top priority for almost all code should be in how easy it is to read and write, because the systems that they are involved in have become so much more complex.

> as the Pragmatic Programmers pointed out, you don’t want to have to comment on what the code is actually doing, you only want to comment on the assumptions that were made in order to write the code.

> **It is more important to focus on the big picture and solve performance problems that are system wide, or refactor code so that changes can be made much faster, than it is to solve a performance problem in a single line of code**

> “Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.”

### [What does a good programmer's code look like?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/366588/what-does-a-good-programmers-code-look-like)

* Good code is well-organized. Data and operations in classes fit together. There aren't extraneous dependencies between classes. It does not look like "spaghetti."
* Good code comments explain why things are done not what is done. The code itself explains what is done. The need for comments should be minimal.
* Good code uses meaningful naming conventions for all but the most transient of objects. the name of something is informative about when and how to use the object.
* Good code is well-tested. Tests serve as an executable specification of the code and examples of its use.
* Good code is not "clever". It does things in straightforward, obvious ways.
* Good code is developed in small, easy to read units of computation. These units are reused throughout the code.
